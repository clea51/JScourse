        const name = 'chris';
        console.log('my name is', name)

        const coffee = 5
        const bagel = 3
        const soup = 9
        let cost = coffee + bagel + bagel + soup

        console.log('Cost of food $$', cost)
        let tax = cost * 0.1
        console.log('Tax (10%) $$', cost * 0.1)
        const totalCost = cost + tax
        console.log('Total cost: $$', totalCost)

<!--
Here is the solution 
    <script>
      const cost = 5 + 2 * 3 + 9;
      console.log(`Cost of food: $${cost}`);

      const tax = cost * 0.1;
    </script>

    Note - i think i did this better in the first part coz i actually broke each of the products out rather than just an equation. 
    cost was a bit different. He uses {cost} where i used , cost. I need to get used to using {}
    tax was similar however I was ligging this and he isn't - so am i really that wrong?
